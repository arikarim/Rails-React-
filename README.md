## Getting Started

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**


**Step 1**<br>

In order to use this project  all you have to to is follow these simple steps :

- Clone the Rails repo and cd inside the project.

- Run `Rake secret`, this will generate a secret key, hold it for the next step.

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and inside it put this `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY = < your secret key from previuos step >`

- Inside `config/initializers/cors.rb` if you it locally you dont need to do this but if you want to use it from specific domain you should change line 12 from `origins '*'` to `origins 'Your domain here'`.

- Note: If you publish this website and upload it to heroku, do not forget to add a `Config variable` to your app in heroku, simply go to heroku, go to your app, click on setting, click on config vars then put your `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` then your secret key.
